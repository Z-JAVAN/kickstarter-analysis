# Kickstarter Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose:
He tries to make informed decisions by analyzing, inspecting and clearing, as well as converting and modeling data and covering useful information. He also tries to put guessing aside.<br/>

## Analysis and Challenges
I tried to solve all the part of the project step by step by reading and searching the booklet and the internet. The chart also helped me a lot to better understand the points and how the data relates and draws conclusions. On the other hand, if I had a problem or made a mistake, I would try to get help from teaching assistants or classmates. My biggest problem was when a formula didn't work and I finally realized I had to remove it from the filter.<br/>
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
### Challenges
![outcomes_vs_launch.png](/resources/outcomes_vs_launch.png)<br/><br/>
According to the graph, in the first 6 months of the year, the campaigns success rate has increased and the graph shows an incresea in campaigns success, but in the second 6 months of the year, the graph shows a decrease, which can be due to cold weather, less desire to leave home or other resones. <br/>


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
### Challenges
![outcomes_vs_launch.png](/resources/outcomes_vs_goals.png)<br/><br/>
Based on the chart, if the campaign goal is $5,000, the success rate will increase to about 60%. If the goal is in the range of $1,000, it can increase by about 75%. So, as the campaign goal decreases, the success rate increases. Hence, the show campaign may have a better chance of success if they reduce their goals. As a result, the higher the campaign goal, such as $25,000 or higher, the better your chances of becoming a failed campaign.<br/>


## Results

    - What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

    - What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

    - What are some limitations of this dataset?

    - What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
