# Kickstarter Analysis
## Overview of Project
Louise, a playwright, wants to start a crowdfunding campaign fund her play, Fever, with estimating a budget of over $10,000.
The purpose is to help Louise to gain a greater understanding of campaigns from start to finish, and we'll be able to set her campaign to mirror other successful ones in the same category.<br/>
### Purpose:
Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.<br/>

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
### Challenges
To get closer look at how campaign length might be tied to its outcome, I should consider time, or more specifically, whether the length of a campaign makes a difference in determining its success. <br/>
![outcomes_vs_launch.png](/resources/outcomes_vs_launch.png)<br/>
According to the graph, in the first 6 months of the year, the campaigns success rate has increased and the graph shows an incresea in campaigns success, but in the second 6 months of the year, the graph shows a decrease, which can be due to cold weather, less desire to leave home by people, or other resones. <br/>


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
### Challenges
In continue, to be more detailed, I need to visualize the percentage of outcome and funding goal data for the “plays” specifically.<br/>
![outcomes_vs_launch.png](/resources/outcomes_vs_goals.png)<br/>
Based on the chart, if the campaign goal is $5,000, the success rate will increase to about 60%. If the goal is in the range of $1,000, it can increase by about 75%. So, as the campaign goal decreases, the success rate increases. Hence, the show campaign may have a better chance of success if they reduce their goals. As a result, the higher the campaign goal, such as $25,000 or higher, the better your chances of becoming a failed campaign.<br/>


## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    1. July has the least canceled theater project campaign.
    2. May and June are the best time to run a campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The most successful capaigns are the ones that have goal less than 5000 or goal between 35000 and 50000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation could be the lack of recent data. By updating the data, we can find more accurate information and more success. There is no current data, the last campaign was in 2017 and the information is not up to date.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?<br/>
  1.We might need a graph to show the relation between the sucessfull rate and the number of backers/plays.<br/>
  2.More raw data from different websites would also help make stronger analyses.<br/>
  3.We can also see which groups of people have the most impact on success rate (female, male or child) and in which age range they have the highest score.

## Recommendation
Based on the results of the charts, it is suggested that Louise take her Plays campaign in May, June and July with a goal less than $1,000 to have a result of up to 80% success. <br/>
